# Add script to path on windows
Deploy the bat scripts to a folder and add the folder to the Environment variable Path on Windows.
You will be able to invoke the scripts by calling the script name.

For example, looking at the dev scripts folder you can call:

```shell script
abaco-kube
```
or

```shell script
abaco-bundles
```
